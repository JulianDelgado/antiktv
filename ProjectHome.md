AntikTV is simple application which is used for watching IPTV of local ISP called "Antik.sk". The problem is their "IPTV" is so crippled, so I (and more importantly my father) can't watch it in any browser or OS. So I create portable frontend. It's basicaly html parser + execution of VLC. It also required wget for internal operations. It is writen in Lazarus (FPC) and works fine on Linux and Windows. Don't expect much, it has only 333 lines of code, 1 combobox, 1 button and 1 listbox. Enjoy!
